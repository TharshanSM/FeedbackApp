# Feedback App

The Feedback App is a simple React website that allows users to add, edit, and delete feedback entries. It leverages the power of React for the frontend, providing an interactive and responsive user interface. The app also utilizes a JSON web server as the backend to store and manage the feedback data.

This project was developed with the help of a tutorial by the YouTuber Traversy Media, and credit goes to them for providing the guidance and inspiration. You can access the deployed website [here](https://tharshansm.github.io/FeedbackApp/).
